Array.from({length: totalPages},(_,i) => i+1)
The expression Array.from({length: totalPages},(_,i) => i+1) is a concise way to generate an array of numbers from 1 to totalPages in JavaScript. It leverages the Array.from() method to create a new array from an array-like or iterable object.
{length: totalPages}:
This creates an object with a length property set to the value of totalPages. Array.from() treats this object as an array-like structure, using the length property to determine the size of the new array.
(_, i) => i + 1:
This is a callback function that is executed for each element in the new array.
_: This represents the value of the current element in the array-like object (which is undefined in this case, hence the _ to indicate it's intentionally ignored).
i: This represents the index of the current element, starting from 0.
i + 1: This expression calculates the value for each element by adding 1 to its index.
In essence, Array.from() iterates from 0 up to totalPages - 1, and for each index i, it executes the callback function, resulting in an array where the element at index i is i + 1. This produces the desired sequence of numbers from 1 to totalPages.
For example, if totalPages is 5, the expression would evaluate as follows:
Array.from({length: 5}, (_, i) => i + 1)
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
